# Spanish Tutor MVP - Project Summary

## 1. Current Status Overview

The Spanish Tutor MVP is a web application that helps users improve their Spanish through interactive lessons. The project has recently undergone significant architectural improvements to achieve feature parity between guest and authenticated user experiences.

### Key Features:
- **Guest Mode**: Full functionality without authentication
- **Authenticated Mode**: Additional features like progress tracking and data persistence
- **Lesson System**: Interactive Spanish lessons with immediate feedback
- **Analysis Engine**: Hidden analysis of user responses for difficulty adjustment
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual feedback on lesson completion

## 2. Recent Architectural Fixes

### Feature Parity Achievement (Just Completed)
We successfully fixed the guest page to match the authenticated page functionality:

1. **Navigation Flow Fix**:
   - Fixed the guest landing page (`/guest`) to properly navigate to lessons
   - Added missing navigation button that was present in authenticated flow
   - Ensured both guest and authenticated users have identical lesson access

2. **Component Standardization**:
   - Both guest and authenticated modes now use the same lesson components
   - Unified the user experience regardless of authentication status
   - Fixed the issue where guest users couldn't access lessons from landing page

### Key Files Modified:
- `/src/pages/GuestPage.tsx` - Added navigation to lessons
- `/src/pages/LessonListPage.tsx` - Handles both guest and authenticated users
- `/src/pages/LessonPage.tsx` - Unified lesson experience

## 3. Key Technical Details

### Architecture:
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Routing**: React Router v6
- **State Management**: React Context API + localStorage
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (authentication, database)

### Component Structure:
```
/src
├── components/
│   ├── LessonCard.tsx
│   ├── LessonComplete.tsx
│   ├── QuestionDisplay.tsx
│   └── AnalysisDisplay.tsx
├── contexts/
│   ├── AuthContext.tsx
│   └── ProgressContext.tsx
├── pages/
│   ├── HomePage.tsx
│   ├── GuestPage.tsx
│   ├── LessonListPage.tsx
│   └── LessonPage.tsx
└── App.tsx
```

### Critical Routes:
- `/` - Home page with auth options
- `/guest` - Guest landing page
- `/lessons` - Lesson list (both modes)
- `/lesson/:id` - Individual lessons

## 4. Remaining Issues

### P1 - Guest Storage Fix
**Issue**: Guest users' progress isn't persisting properly
**Details**: 
- localStorage implementation may have issues
- Progress context might not be saving for guest users
- Need to verify data persistence across page refreshes

### P2 - Component Lifecycle Standardization
**Issue**: Inconsistent component mounting/unmounting behavior
**Details**:
- Some components may have memory leaks
- Event listeners not being properly cleaned up
- Need to audit all useEffect hooks

### P3 - Hidden Analysis Verification
**Issue**: Unclear if the hidden analysis is working correctly
**Details**:
- Analysis should happen behind the scenes
- Results should influence future question difficulty
- Need to verify the analysis pipeline is functioning

### P4 - UI/UX Polish
**Issue**: Minor inconsistencies in UI
**Details**:
- Loading states need improvement
- Error handling could be more user-friendly
- Mobile responsiveness needs testing

## 5. Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Priority Order):

1. **Fix Guest Storage** (2-3 hours)
   - Debug localStorage implementation in ProgressContext
   - Ensure guest progress persists across sessions
   - Add logging to track storage operations
   - Test edge cases (browser privacy modes, etc.)

2. **Standardize Component Lifecycle** (3-4 hours)
   - Audit all components for proper cleanup
   - Standardize useEffect patterns
   - Add proper error boundaries
   - Implement consistent loading/error states

3. **Verify Hidden Analysis** (2-3 hours)
   - Add debug logging to analysis pipeline
   - Verify difficulty adjustment algorithm
   - Ensure analysis results are being stored
   - Test with various user response patterns

4. **Begin Phase 4 Planning** (1-2 hours)
   - Review requirements for next phase
   - Identify new features to implement
   - Plan database schema changes if needed
   - Create implementation roadmap

### Code Entry Points:
- Start with `/src/contexts/ProgressContext.tsx` for storage issues
- Check `/src/components/QuestionDisplay.tsx` for analysis logic
- Review `/src/pages/LessonPage.tsx` for component lifecycle

### Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Guest user can complete a lesson
- [ ] Progress persists after page refresh
- [ ] Analysis adjusts difficulty appropriately
- [ ] No console errors during normal usage
- [ ] Mobile experience is smooth

## Important Notes for Next Session

1. **Current Working State**: The app is functional but has the storage persistence issue for guest users
2. **No Breaking Changes**: All recent fixes maintained backward compatibility
3. **Feature Parity Achieved**: Guest and authenticated experiences are now aligned
4. **Focus Area**: Priority should be on fixing guest storage before moving to Phase 4
