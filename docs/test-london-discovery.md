# The Hidden Tudor Banquet Hall of Aldgate

*A Recent Archaeological Discovery in London*

## Executive Summary

In March 2024, construction workers renovating the basement of a modern office building at 47 Aldgate High Street made an extraordinary discovery. Behind a false wall dating to the Victorian era, archaeologists uncovered a perfectly preserved Tudor banquet hall, complete with original oak paneling, decorative plasterwork, and what appears to be Henry VIII's personal dining chair.

## Historical Context

The building sits on land that was once part of the Holy Trinity Priory, dissolved by Henry VIII in 1532 during the English Reformation. Historical records from the Guildhall Archives suggest that the King frequently used this location for private feasts with foreign ambassadors, away from the scrutiny of the court at Whitehall Palace.

## Key Discoveries

### The Great Hearth
- Original Tudor fireplace with Henry VIII's rose and crown motif
- Cooking implements dating to 1540-1547 (final years of Henry's reign)
- Remnants of exotic spices: saffron, cinnamon, and what appears to be early pepper imports

### The Royal Chair
- Carved oak throne-style chair with the Tudor rose
- Gilded armrests showing significant wear patterns
- Hidden compartment containing a sealed letter in Latin (currently being translated)

### Wall Paintings
- Frescoes depicting scenes from Arthurian legend
- Portrait believed to be Catherine Parr (Henry's sixth wife)
- Astronomical charts showing constellation positions for 1545

## Archaeological Significance

Dr. Margaret Thornfield of the Museum of London calls this "the most significant Tudor discovery since the Rose Theatre excavations." The preservation is remarkable due to the room being sealed with lime mortar, creating an oxygen-free environment.

## Current Status

The site is temporarily closed to the public while English Heritage conducts a full survey. Plans are underway to convert the space into a museum annex, potentially opening to visitors by Christmas 2024.

## Connection to Modern London

This discovery sits just 200 meters from the Tower of London, where Henry VIII had two of his wives executed. The proximity suggests this banquet hall may have been used for Henry's final meal celebrations before proceeding to more grim business at the Tower.

Local historian James Whitmore notes: "This changes our understanding of Henry's final years. Rather than the isolated, paranoid king of popular imagination, we see evidence of continued diplomatic entertaining and scholarly pursuits."
