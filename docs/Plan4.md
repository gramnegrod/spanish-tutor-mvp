  4.2: Progression Logic System

  Unlocking Mechanism:
  - Performance-based: 70% success rate + 15+ exchanges in current scenario
  - Vocabulary mastery: 80% of scenario vocabulary marked as "mastered"
  - Confidence threshold: Average confidence > 0.65 in last 3 sessions
  - Time investment: Minimum 30 minutes total practice in scenario

  Difficulty Adaptation:
  - Auto-adjustment within scenarios based on real-time performance
  - Vocabulary complexity scaling (basic â†’ intermediate â†’ advanced phrases)
  - Cultural context depth increases with proficiency
  - Error tolerance adapts to user's demonstrated level

  4.3: Cross-Scenario Features

  Vocabulary Retention System:
  - Track word usage across different scenarios
  - Reinforce previously learned vocabulary in new contexts
  - "Vocabulary bridge" exercises connecting scenarios
  - Spaced repetition for struggling words across contexts

  Achievement & Badge System:
  - Scenario Completion Badges: "Taco Master", "Market Navigator", etc.
  - Skill Badges: "Pronunciation Pro", "Cultural Expert", "Vocabulary Builder"
  - Streak Badges: "3-Day Streak", "Weekly Warrior", "Monthly Master"
  - Progress Milestones: "First 100 Words", "Beginner Graduate", etc.

  4.4: Scenario Selection UI

  Smart Recommendations:
  - Analyze user's weak areas and suggest relevant scenarios
  - "Based on your pronunciation practice, try Restaurant Ordering"
  - "You've mastered food vocabulary, ready for Market Shopping?"
  - Visual difficulty indicators and estimated completion time

  Phase 5: Enhanced Analytics Dashboard (PRIORITY 3)

  Goal: Rich insights and personalized learning paths

  Dashboard Views:
  1. Progress Overview: Line charts, vocabulary growth, practice calendar
  2. Detailed Metrics: Error patterns, improvement areas, success rates
  3. Personalized Insights: Weekly focus areas, scenario recommendations
  4. Export Features: Progress reports, vocabulary lists, certificates

  Phase 6: Production Readiness (PRIORITY 4)

  Goal: Prepare for public launch
  1. Performance & Reliability: Error boundaries, reconnection logic, offline mode
  2. User Experience Polish: Onboarding, help system, mobile responsive
  3. Infrastructure: Error tracking, analytics, cost monitoring
  4. Content Management: Admin panel, A/B testing, user feedback

  ðŸš€ Phase 4 Implementation Strategy

  Development Approach:

  1. Start with Market Shopping scenario (most requested, clear learning objectives)
  2. Build progression logic incrementally (unlock system, then badges)
  3. Test with existing user base before adding more scenarios
  4. Focus on user engagement - clear progress indicators and achievements

  Technical Implementation:

  // Enhanced scenario structure
  interface Scenario {
    id: string;
    title: string;
    difficulty: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced';
    prerequisites: string[]; // Previous scenario IDs required
    unlockCriteria: {
      successRate: number;
      vocabularyMastery: number;
      averageConfidence: number;
      minPracticeTime: number;
    };
    adaptiveFeatures: {
      vocabularyProgression: string[][];
      culturalComplexity: 'basic' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced';
      errorTolerance: number;
    };
  }

  Database Updates Needed:

  -- New tables for Phase 4
  CREATE TABLE scenario_progress (
    user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    scenario_id TEXT,
    status TEXT, -- 'locked', 'available', 'in_progress', 'completed'
    completion_date TIMESTAMP,
    best_performance JSONB,
    total_practice_time INTEGER
  );

  CREATE TABLE user_achievements (
    user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    achievement_id TEXT,
    earned_date TIMESTAMP,
    scenario_context TEXT
  );

  ðŸŽ¯ Success Metrics for Phase 4

  Engagement Metrics:
  - Scenario completion rate: Target 75% for unlocked scenarios
  - Cross-scenario vocabulary retention: Target 80% retention rate
  - Session length increase: Target 20% longer sessions with multiple scenarios
  - Return rate: Target 80% users return to try new scenarios

  Learning Metrics:
  - Vocabulary growth acceleration: Target 30% faster with multiple contexts
  - Cultural knowledge improvement: Measurable through hidden analysis
  - Confidence building: Track confidence trends across scenarios
  - Real-world application: User feedback on practical usage

  ðŸ“… Estimated Timeline

  Phase 4 Total: 3-4 weeks
  - Week 1: Market Shopping scenario + progression logic
  - Week 2: Restaurant Ordering scenario + achievement system
  - Week 3: Directions scenario + cross-scenario vocabulary
  - Week 4: Polish, testing, and Hotel scenario (if time permits)

  ðŸ”‘ Key Technical Details

  Current Working Foundation:
  - Taco ordering scenario fully functional with adaptive learning
  - Real-time progress feedback system operational
  - Guest and authenticated user persistence working
  - Hidden analysis system providing rich learning data

  Ready for Enhancement:
  - Scenario infrastructure exists and can be extended
  - Database schema supports multiple scenarios
  - UI components are modular and reusable
  - Adaptive learning engine is scenario-agnostic

  ðŸŽ¬ Immediate Next Steps for Phase 4

  1. Design Market Shopping scenario content (personas, phrases, cultural notes)
  2. Implement scenario unlocking logic in the existing progression system
  3. Create scenario selection UI with progress indicators
  4. Build achievement badge system for motivation
  5. Test progression flow with real conversations

  The enhanced progress feedback from Phase 3.5 provides the perfect foundation for Phase 4 - users now have clear visibility into their
  learning progress, making scenario progression and achievements much more engaging and meaningful
