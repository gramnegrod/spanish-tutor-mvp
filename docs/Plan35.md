# Spanish Tutor MVP - Development Plan (Updated February 2025)

## ðŸ“Š Current Status Overview

**Progress: 3 of 6 phases complete (50% done)**

### âœ… Completed Phases

#### Phase 1: Adaptive Learning Foundation (COMPLETE)
**Accomplishments:**
- **Enhanced Comprehension Detection** - Fixed Spanish recognition, added 60+ Mexican expressions
- **Dynamic AI Behavior** - Real-time switching between "Spanish Focus" and "Bilingual Helper" modes
- **Rich Vocabulary Tracking** - Tracks diminutives, multi-word phrases, cultural expressions
- **Persistent Learning Patterns** - User adaptations save/load from Supabase
- **CLT Integration** - Error tolerance scales with level, natural code-switching (60/40 for beginners)

#### Phase 2: Hidden Analysis System (COMPLETE - February 2025)
**What We Built:**
1. **AI Prompt Enhancement**
   - Added hidden `<!--ANALYSIS:pronunciation=X,fluency=Y,errors=[...],strengths=[...],confidence=Z-->` comments
   - Implemented in `generateAdaptivePrompt()` in `/src/lib/pedagogical-system.ts`
   - AI includes analysis after EVERY response, completely invisible to users

2. **Analysis Extraction System**
   - Created `extractHiddenAnalysis()` function - parses and strips comments
   - Clean text displayed to user, analysis processed separately
   - Graceful fallbacks for malformed analysis

3. **Dynamic Profile Updates**
   - `updateProfileFromAnalysis()` enriches profiles with pronunciation/fluency
   - Running average confidence (70% history weight, 30% new)
   - Automatic level progression based on fluency + confidence
   - Error patterns tracked as struggling words

4. **Real-time UI Feedback**
   - Live pronunciation indicator (poorâ†’fairâ†’goodâ†’excellent)
   - Fluency progression (haltingâ†’developingâ†’conversationalâ†’fluent)
   - Confidence meter with percentage display
   - All updates transparent during conversation

**Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
// AI sends hidden analysis:
"Â¡Ã“rale! Dos tacos de pastor!"
<!--ANALYSIS:pronunciation=good,fluency=developing,errors=[gender_agreement],strengths=[food_vocabulary;ordering_phrases],confidence=0.7-->

// User sees only:
"Â¡Ã“rale! Dos tacos de pastor!"

// Profile updates with:
{
  pronunciation: 'good',
  fluency: 'developing',
  averageConfidence: 0.65,
  strugglingWords: [...prev, 'gender_agreement'],
  masteredPhrases: [...prev, 'food_vocabulary', 'ordering_phrases']
}
```

### ðŸ”§ Additional Fixes Completed

   - Progress metrics updated (pronunciation, grammar, fluency, cultural)
   - Vocabulary extraction and tracking
   - User adaptations persist across sessions

#### Phase 3: Fix Authentication & Persistence (COMPLETE - February 2025)
**What We Built:**
1. **Modern Supabase Auth Migration**
   - Removed all NextAuth remnants (deleted `/src/types/next-auth.d.ts`)
   - Upgraded to `@supabase/ssr` package (replaced deprecated auth-helpers)
   - Fixed security: middleware now uses `getUser()` instead of `getSession()`
   - Implemented proper cookie management with `getAll/setAll` pattern
   - Fixed all TypeScript errors and build issues

2. **Guest Mode Implementation**
   - Created `GuestStorageService` for localStorage-based persistence
   - Built `UnifiedStorageService` handling both guest and authenticated users
   - Real-time progress tracking (conversations, vocabulary, learner profiles)
   - Smart signup prompts based on usage thresholds

3. **Enhanced Practice Pages**
   - `/practice-no-auth` has full feature parity with authenticated mode
   - Progress card showing conversations and practice minutes
   - Automatic profile saving with adaptive learning persistence
   - "End Session" functionality with proper data saving
   - Guest-to-user migration system ready for implementation

**Technical Accomplishments:**
