# Spanish Tutor MVP - Development Plan (Updated February 2025)

## ðŸ“Š Current Status Overview

### âœ… Completed Phases

#### Phase 1: Adaptive Learning Foundation (COMPLETE)
**Accomplishments:**
- **Enhanced Comprehension Detection** - Fixed Spanish recognition, added 60+ Mexican expressions
- **Dynamic AI Behavior** - Real-time switching between "Spanish Focus" and "Bilingual Helper" modes
- **Rich Vocabulary Tracking** - Tracks diminutives, multi-word phrases, cultural expressions
- **Persistent Learning Patterns** - User adaptations save/load from Supabase
- **CLT Integration** - Error tolerance scales with level, natural code-switching (60/40 for beginners)

#### Phase 2: Hidden Analysis System (COMPLETE - February 2025)
**What We Built:**
1. **AI Prompt Enhancement**
   - Added hidden `<!--ANALYSIS:pronunciation=X,fluency=Y,errors=[...],strengths=[...],confidence=Z-->` comments
   - Implemented in `generateAdaptivePrompt()` in `/src/lib/pedagogical-system.ts`
   - AI includes analysis after EVERY response, completely invisible to users

2. **Analysis Extraction System**
   - Created `extractHiddenAnalysis()` function - parses and strips comments
   - Clean text displayed to user, analysis processed separately
   - Graceful fallbacks for malformed analysis

3. **Dynamic Profile Updates**
   - `updateProfileFromAnalysis()` enriches profiles with pronunciation/fluency
   - Running average confidence (70% history weight, 30% new)
   - Automatic level progression based on fluency + confidence
   - Error patterns tracked as struggling words

4. **Real-time UI Feedback**
   - Live pronunciation indicator (poorâ†’fairâ†’goodâ†’excellent)
   - Fluency progression (haltingâ†’developingâ†’conversationalâ†’fluent)
   - Confidence meter with percentage display
   - All updates transparent during conversation

**Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
// AI sends hidden analysis:
"Â¡Ã“rale! Dos tacos de pastor!"
<!--ANALYSIS:pronunciation=good,fluency=developing,errors=[gender_agreement],strengths=[food_vocabulary;ordering_phrases],confidence=0.7-->

// User sees only:
"Â¡Ã“rale! Dos tacos de pastor!"

// Profile updates with:
{
  pronunciation: 'good',
  fluency: 'developing',
  averageConfidence: 0.65,
  strugglingWords: [...prev, 'gender_agreement'],
  masteredPhrases: [...prev, 'food_vocabulary', 'ordering_phrases']
}
```

### ðŸ”§ Additional Fixes Completed

1. **Session Management** 
   - Fixed audio continuing after navigation
   - Added cleanup on component unmount
   - Disabled auto-timeout for practice-no-auth
   - Fixed max sessions navigation issues

2. **Adaptive Practice Page**
   - Fixed missing transcript display (config was undefined)
   - Added ConversationUI component integration
   - Fixed React rendering errors with object-based mistakes

   - Conversations saved with full transcripts
   - Progress metrics updated (pronunciation, grammar, fluency, cultural)
   - Vocabulary extraction and tracking
   - User adaptations persist across sessions

## ðŸŽ¯ Remaining Development Phases

### Phase 3: Fix Authentication & Persistence (Priority 1) 
**Goal**: Enable full app experience with proper auth flow

**Current Issues:**

   - Update session management to use Supabase

2. **Guest Mode Enhancement** (1-2 hours)
   - Implement localStorage for non-authenticated practice
   - Track guest progress temporarily
   - Show "Sign up to save progress" prompts at milestones

   - Allow testing all features without login

3. **Auth UI Improvements** (1 hour)
   - Clear login/signup flow
   - Social auth options
   - Remember me functionality
   - Password reset flow
