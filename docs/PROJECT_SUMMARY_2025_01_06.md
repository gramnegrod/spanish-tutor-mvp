# Spanish Tutor MVP - Project Summary
*Generated: January 6, 2025*

## üéØ Project Overview

**Spanish Tutor MVP** is an AI-powered conversational Spanish learning application that enables real-time voice conversations with authentic Mexican NPCs (Non-Player Characters). The app uses OpenAI's Realtime API for natural voice interactions and implements adaptive learning based on Communicative Language Teaching (CLT) principles.

## üèÜ What We Just Accomplished

### 1. **Universal Practice Page (`/practice-v2`)**
- Created a unified practice experience that works with any NPC
- Integrated the new NPC system for dynamic character loading
- Supports both single NPC practice and adventure mode
- Query parameters: `?dest=mexico-city&npc=taco_vendor&mode=single`

### 2. **NPC System Implementation**
- Built JSON-based NPC loader (`/src/lib/npc-system/`)
- 11 fully configured Mexico City NPCs with unique personalities
- Dynamic prompt building with learner adaptation
- Vocabulary extraction from NPC data

### 3. **Multi-Destination Session Hook**
- `useMultiDestinationSession` extends the base practice session
- Handles NPC loading, prompt building, and adaptation
- Supports future expansion to other destinations
- Adventure mode hooks for sequential NPC experiences

### 4. **Navigation Improvements**
- Character switcher component (FAB with purple button)
- NPC selector page (`/practice-v2/select-npc`)
- Multiple entry points from homepage and dashboard
- Browse all 11 characters with learning goals displayed

## üìä Current Project State

### Working Features
1. **Voice Conversations**: Real-time Spanish conversations with OpenAI Realtime API
2. **11 NPCs**: Each with unique personality, vocabulary, and scenarios
3. **Adaptive Learning**: AI adjusts support based on comprehension detection
4. **Spanish Analysis**: Real-time tracking of vocabulary usage and patterns
5. **Session Management**: Cost tracking, time warnings, session summaries
6. **Authentication**: Supabase auth with guest mode support
7. **Persistence**: Learning profiles and progress saved to database

### Active Pages
- `/practice-v2` - Universal practice with any NPC ‚úÖ
- `/practice-v2/select-npc` - Character selection interface ‚úÖ
- `/practice` - Classic taco vendor (authenticated) ‚úÖ
- `/practice-no-auth` - Guest mode practice ‚úÖ
- `/adaptive-practice` - Structured learning scenarios ‚úÖ
- `/dashboard` - User dashboard with quick actions ‚úÖ

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (Auth + PostgreSQL)
- **AI/Voice**: OpenAI Realtime API, WebRTC
- **State**: React hooks, Context API
- **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend), Supabase Cloud (backend)

## ‚úÖ What's Working

### Core Functionality
- Voice recognition and synthesis in Spanish
- Real-time transcription display
- NPC personality system with 11 unique characters
- Adaptive AI behavior based on learner performance
- Session cost tracking and management
- Time-based warnings and limits

### Learning Features
- Spanish vocabulary tracking (60+ words/phrases)
- Comprehension detection and scoring
- Dynamic support level adjustment
- Cultural expression recognition
- Session summaries with analysis

### Technical Infrastructure
- Modular component architecture
- Reusable hooks for session management
- Type-safe NPC system
- Efficient prompt building
- Clean separation of concerns

## üêõ Remaining Issues

### Known Limitations
1. **Character Switcher Hidden**: Currently commented out in practice page
2. **No Global Navigation**: Must return to homepage/dashboard to switch features
3. **Limited Visual Feedback**: Progress indicators could be enhanced
4. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Some components need mobile optimization

### Technical Debt
1. **Multiple Practice Pages**: Several experimental versions still exist
2. **Incomplete Migration**: Some old auth/DB code remains
3. **Missing Tests**: No automated test coverage
4. **Build Warnings**: Some TypeScript strict mode issues

## üöÄ Next Steps and Priorities

### Immediate (Phase 3 Completion)
1. **Unhide Character Switcher**: Re-enable the purple FAB button
2. **Global Navigation**: Add persistent nav bar with character access
3. **Mobile Polish**: Optimize for phone/tablet usage
4. **Cleanup**: Remove experimental practice pages

### Phase 4: Scenario Progression System
- **Adventure Mode**: Sequential NPC conversations
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual journey through Mexico City
- **Unlockables**: New NPCs/locations based on performance
- **Achievements**: Gamification elements

### Phase 5: Enhanced Analytics Dashboard
- **Learning Insights**: Detailed progress visualizations
- **Vocabulary Mastery**: Track word acquisition over time
- **Conversation Patterns**: Analyze speaking confidence
- **Recommendations**: Personalized learning paths

### Phase 6: Production Readiness
- **Performance**: Optimize bundle size and load times
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage
- **Documentation**: User guides and API docs
- **Monitoring**: Error tracking and analytics

## üîß Technical Context Needed

### Key Files and Patterns

#### NPC System
```typescript
// Loading NPCs
import { getNPC, getAllNPCs } from '@/lib/npc-system'

// Using in components
const { npc, isLoading, error } = useMultiDestinationSession({
  destinationId: 'mexico-city',
  npcId: 'taco_vendor'
})
```

#### Session Management
```typescript
// Base hook for any practice scenario
const session = usePracticeSession({
  scenario: 'restaurant',
  npcName: 'Carlos',
  npcDescription: 'Professional waiter'
})
```

#### Component Architecture
- `PracticeLayout` - Consistent page wrapper
- `SpanishAnalyticsDashboard` - Learning metrics
- `ConversationSession` - Transcript display
- `VoiceControl` - Audio interface
- `SessionModals` - Warnings and summaries

### Environment Variables
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
OPENAI_API_KEY=
```

### Database Schema
- `users` - User profiles
- `learning_profiles` - Adaptive learning data
- `practice_sessions` - Session history
- `vocabulary_progress` - Word mastery tracking

### Deployment
- Frontend: Vercel (automatic from GitHub)
- Database: Supabase Cloud
- Domain: spanish-tutor-mvp.vercel.app

## üìù Important Notes

### Architecture Decisions
1. **JSON-based NPCs**: Easier to add/modify characters
2. **Hook-based State**: Promotes reusability
3. **Modular Components**: 77% code reduction achieved
4. **Guest Mode**: Allows trying before signing up

### Pedagogical Approach
- CLT (Communicative Language Teaching) principles
- Task-based learning (order tacos, check into hotel)
- Error tolerance for communication focus
- Cultural authenticity with Mexican Spanish

### Future Considerations
- Multi-language support (beyond Spanish)
- More destinations (Barcelona, Buenos Aires)
- Group practice sessions
- Mobile app version
- Offline practice mode

## üéâ Success Metrics

### Current Achievement
- 11 unique NPCs with distinct personalities
- 60+ tracked vocabulary items
- Real-time comprehension adaptation
- 5-minute new scenario creation time
- Working authentication with guest mode

### User Experience
- Natural voice conversations
- Immediate practice access
- Visual learning feedback
- Session cost transparency
- Progress persistence

This project has successfully created a foundation for immersive Spanish learning through conversational AI. The modular architecture allows rapid expansion while maintaining code quality and user experience.
