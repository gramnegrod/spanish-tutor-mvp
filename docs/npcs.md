Each NPC includes:

Persona Prompt – what you feed the LLM so it role-plays the character (the prompt tells the model to answer in Spanish, but the prompt itself is in English).
Scene & Back-Story – several English paragraphs that set context.
Prices / Practical Facts – numbers, item names, fees.
Canonical Answers – fixed English descriptions of how the NPC will respond to common traveler questions (use these as ground-truth samples or unit tests).
Spanish words appear only for things like menu items, slang, or place names.
