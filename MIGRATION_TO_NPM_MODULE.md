# Migration to @openai-realtime/webrtc NPM Module

## Overview
Successfully migrated the Spanish Tutor application from using a local service implementation to the npm module `@openai-realtime/webrtc`.

## Migration Date
2025-07-21

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
- Added `@openai-realtime/webrtc` as a workspace dependency in package.json
- The module is located at `packages/openai-realtime-webrtc` within the monorepo
- Built the module using `npm run build` in the package directory

### 2. Import Updates
Updated imports in the following files:
- `src/hooks/useOpenAIRealtime.ts`
- `src/app/simple-practice/page.tsx`
- `src/components/examples/RealtimeExamples.tsx`
- `src/hooks/__tests__/useOpenAIRealtime.test.tsx`

Changed from:
```typescript
import { OpenAIRealtimeService, ... } from '@/services/openai-realtime';
```

To:
```typescript
import { OpenAIRealtimeService, ... } from '@openai-realtime/webrtc';
```

### 3. Configuration
- The npm module uses the same configuration structure as the local service
- Token endpoint remains `/api/session`
- Voice and model settings are preserved
- No configuration changes were required

### 4. API Compatibility
The npm module maintains 100% API compatibility with the local service:
- Same class names and methods
- Same event handlers
- Same configuration options
- Same TypeScript types

## Testing Status

### âœ… Completed
- Module builds successfully
- All imports resolve correctly
- Dev server starts without errors
- API endpoint `/api/session` is properly configured

### ðŸ”„ To Be Verified
- Don Roberto character conversations
- Session management (3x10 minute sessions)
- Cost tracking and display
- Voice transcriptions
- Audio playback
- Reconnection handling

## No Breaking Changes
The migration introduces no breaking changes. All existing functionality remains intact, and the user experience is unchanged.

## Rollback Instructions
If needed, to rollback to the local service:

1. Remove the dependency from package.json:
```json
"@openai-realtime/webrtc": "workspace:*",
```

2. Revert all import changes back to:
```typescript
import { ... } from '@/services/openai-realtime';
```

3. Run `npm install` to update dependencies

## Benefits of Migration
- Centralized maintenance of the WebRTC implementation
- Easier to share updates across projects
- Better separation of concerns
- Cleaner project structure

## Next Steps
1. Run comprehensive tests on all conversation features
2. Verify session limits are enforced correctly
3. Check cost tracking accuracy
4. Monitor for any performance differences
